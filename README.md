# OOP_Bank
This was one of the first coding projects I had to do in school for the C# programming course. 

OOP ATM (Bankomat)

Create a program according to good Object-Oriented Programming standards.

Create a class that contains:

    Account number
    Name
    Interest rate
    Balance
    Max credit limit

It should not be possible to withdraw more than the credit limit from the account.

It should be possible to create any number of accounts dynamically.

Have the following menu options:

    Make a deposit to an account
    Make a withdrawal from an account
    Display the balance of an account
    Print a list of all account numbers and balances

VG (Very Good)

    Everything for G (Good)
    Option to distribute interest to all accounts through a menu choice
    Ability to sort by balance and interest rate, both in ascending and descending order
